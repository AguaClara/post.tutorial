# Git Branching and Merging Tutorial

**Don't do this if you haven't completed your Angular tutorial.**

## What To Do:
* Create a branch off of this current branch, and style the CSS to make the application your own 
* Get familiar with the pull -> add -> commit -> push workflow
* Be creative with your styling!

If you are not familiar with Git, or need a refresher, [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) tutorial provides a good explanation of the version control and Git in general, and walks you through the basics.

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) provides a great resource and guide to CSS, if you haven't been exposed to it before.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you can run ```npm start``` from the folder containing the README. If not, run ```npm install``` beforehand.
